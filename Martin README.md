# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: Software Engineering refers to the use of Engineering principles and methodology to design, implement, test, deploy and maintain high level softwares applications example development of whatsapp, facebook and others. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering refers to the act of developing a software through applying knowledge of engineering principles, software engineering is also involve use of science while traditional programming involves use of programming language to create softwares with specific features to perform certain tasks,may not invovle use of science engineering 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirements phase involves understainding the user needs and ways how to fulfill them
Design phase involves developing a plan to be executed on how to create a software that may fulfill user needs. 
Implementing phase involves putting plan into action by coding a software that fits the user needs and requirements.
Testing phase involves to experimenting a software, testing on software features effectiveness to perform various tasks. 
Maintainance phase involve support from users and other legal forms, with series of updates on feature softwares overtime
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile model is the one which doesnot follow sequencial phase of software development in which may change within phases from time to time waterfall model involves follows sequence of software development from phase to phase where developer needs to complete one phase to move to the next phase. 
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
They are both methodologies used in software development. waterfall is useful for beginners as it enable one to learn each stage in depth as what is needed in each stage to develop a software while agile is useful for experts and more experienced software developers. Agile also is useful in long term software development projects while waterfall is useful for short term projects. Example of scenarios, use of waterfall for development of mobile money application software and use of agile for global money transfer. 
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement Engineering refers to use of science engineering to set up tools and needs to be used for the engineering process. 
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is the way in developing a software that reduces the dependence of the software on system components. It improves the maintainability and scalability by bringing independence on softwares functions and operations. 
Testing in Software Engineering: 
Testing in software engineering refers to experimenting software application features on its effectiveness to perform and complete required tasks. 

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing, is the level of testing on specific unit of software applications
integration testing refers to testing on softwares on their ability to be integrated with different units
system testing refers to testing on whole system software on its features and its applicability to users. 
acceptance software refers to the testing on ability of software to be accepted to users. Testing is very crucial in software development as it helps to spot out defects that require changes or modification for a software to be effective. 
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems refers to computer programms that enable tracking and management of changes in software code. These are important in tracking changes in codes of software which enable to manage version of computer program. Example Git-Git history,AWS codecommit 
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager is overall responsible to oversee all activities involved during software development from requirements phase, design, implementation, testing, deployment to user and  maintainance also collects feedback from users on their experiences with the application and suggest ways on its improvement.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintainance refers to the practice of making changes or modifying software application depending on user needs to fit their requirements. There are several types involved in maintainance such as corrective, adaptive, preventive. 
corrective involves software maintanance actions to correct errors existed during programming. 
adaptive involve programming software that may easily compatible with user environment easy to change with environment. 
preventive involve establishing security and other measures to safeguard the software from being hacked or failure to operate. Reference: castsoftware.com
Maintanance is essential in software life cycle since may lead software to exist for a long time in the market. 
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
The ethical issues faced by software engineers are so many but to mention few are as follows
Intellectual property rights. Software engineers face problems of being imitated their work or project done. 
Algorithm bias. Software engineers face problem of inputing data which may be bias that may provide bias information. 
Hacking. This is unethical act where a software developer may break into person's computer data and interfere with his/her privacy. Software engineers may adhere to ethical standards by acting with integrity, confidentiality, and objevtively through out his course of work.
